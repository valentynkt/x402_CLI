# Quick Start Guide: Hello World in 90 Seconds

**Time:** 10 minutes (detailed walkthrough) | **Difficulty:** Beginner | **Prerequisites:** Rust 1.75+

This guide walks you through creating your first payment-protected API with x402-dev. By the end, you'll have a working server that returns HTTP 402 status codes with Solana payment invoices.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- ✅ **Rust 1.75+** installed - Check with `rustc --version`
  - Don't have Rust? Install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) (takes 2 minutes)
- ✅ **Terminal/command line** access
- ✅ **curl** or similar HTTP client for testing
- ✅ **5 minutes** of uninterrupted time

**Don't need blockchain knowledge** - x402-dev handles everything!

---

## Step 1: Install x402-dev (30 seconds)

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
cargo install x402-dev
```

**Expected output:**
```
    Updating crates.io index
  Installing x402-dev v0.1.0
   Compiling x402-cli v0.1.0
   Compiling x402-core v0.1.0
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 18.45s
  Installing /Users/you/.cargo/bin/x402-dev
   Installed package `x402-dev v0.1.0`
```

**Verify installation:**
```bash
x402-dev --version
```

✅ **Success!** You should see: `x402-dev 0.1.0`

---

## Step 2: Initialize Your Project (15 seconds)

Create a new directory for your API:

```bash
x402-dev init my-payment-api
cd my-payment-api
```

**What just happened:**
- ✅ Created `.x402dev.yaml` configuration file
- ✅ Set default port (3402) and pricing (0.000001 SOL)
- ✅ Configured Solana devnet (free testing network)

**View your configuration:**
```bash
cat .x402dev.yaml
```

You'll see:
```yaml
# x402-dev configuration (generated by: x402-dev init)
mock_server:
  port: 3402
  pricing:
    default: 0.01
solana:
  rpc_url: https://api.devnet.solana.com
  network: devnet
```

---

## Step 3: Start Mock Server (20 seconds)

Launch the x402-dev mock facilitator:

```bash
x402-dev mock
```

**Expected output:**
```
✅ Config loaded: .x402dev.yaml
✅ Mock server starting on port 3402
✅ Mock payment processor ready
🚀 Server running at http://localhost:3402

Press Ctrl+C to stop
```

**What is mock mode?**
Mock mode simulates the x402 payment protocol **without touching the blockchain**. Perfect for:
- 🧪 Local development
- ✅ Testing in CI/CD
- 🎓 Learning the protocol
- ⚡ Instant feedback (no waiting for blockchain confirmations)

**Keep this terminal open** - the server is running!

---

## Step 4: Test Your API (25 seconds)

Open a **new terminal** and test the endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3402/api/data
```

**Expected response (HTTP 402):**
```http
HTTP/1.1 402 Payment Required
WWW-Authenticate: x402-solana recipient=7xKXtg2CW87d97TXJSDpbD5jBkheTqA83TZRuJosgAsU amount=1000 currency=USDC memo=req-1731393847123 network=devnet
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "error": "Payment required",
  "amount_lamports": 1000,
  "currency": "USDC",
  "message": "Pay 0.000001 SOL to access this endpoint",
  "invoice": {
    "recipient": "7xKXtg2CW87d97TXJSDpbD5jBkheTqA83TZRuJosgAsU",
    "amount": 1000,
    "memo": "req-1731393847123",
    "network": "devnet"
  }
}
```

✅ **Perfect!** You just received a 402 Payment Required response with a Solana invoice.

**What just happened:**
1. Your request hit the x402-dev mock server
2. Server generated a payment invoice (Solana devnet)
3. Returned HTTP 402 with invoice details in `WWW-Authenticate` header
4. Client can now pay the invoice to access the protected content

---

## Step 5: Verify the Workflow (Optional - 2 minutes)

Let's understand what we built:

### Check Server Status
```bash
x402-dev mock status
```

**Output:**
```
✅ Mock server is running
   PID: 12345
   Port: 3402
   Uptime: 2m 34s
```

### View Configuration
```bash
x402-dev config show
```

**Output:**
```
x402-dev Configuration
=====================

Configuration Priority:
  CLI flags > Environment variables > Project config > Global config > Defaults

Current Configuration:
  port: 3402 (source: project config)
  solana_rpc: https://api.devnet.solana.com (source: project config)
  log_level: info (source: default)
```

### Validate API Compliance
```bash
x402-dev check http://localhost:3402/api/data
```

**Output:**
```
x402 API Compliance Check
=========================

Checking: http://localhost:3402/api/data

Protocol Validation:
  ✅ HTTP 402 status code: PASS
  ✅ WWW-Authenticate header: PASS

Invoice Structure:
  ✅ Field 'recipient': present
  ✅ Field 'amount': present
  ✅ Field 'currency': present
  ✅ Field 'memo': present
  ✅ Field 'network': present
  ✅ Recipient address: 7xKXtg2C... (valid Base58)
  ✅ Amount: 1000 USDC
  ✅ Currency: USDC
  ✅ Memo: req-1731393847123
  ✅ Network: devnet

Overall: ✅ ALL CHECKS PASSED (12/12)
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Port 3402 already in use"

**Cause:** Another process (or previous x402-dev instance) is using the port.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Option 1: Use a different port
x402-dev mock --port 8402

# Option 2: Kill the existing process
lsof -i :3402  # Find process ID (PID)
kill -9 <PID>  # Replace <PID> with actual number

# Option 3: Stop x402-dev cleanly
x402-dev mock stop
```

---

### "Solana RPC connection failed"

**Cause:** Solana devnet might be temporarily down or rate-limiting.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Test RPC connection
curl https://api.devnet.solana.com -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getHealth"}'

# If down, use alternative RPC
x402-dev mock --rpc https://devnet.helius-rpc.com
```

**Prevention:** Configure fallback RPC in `.x402dev.yaml`

---

### "Command not found: x402-dev"

**Cause:** Cargo bin directory not in PATH.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check if cargo bin is in PATH
echo $PATH | grep .cargo/bin

# If not, add to your shell profile (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.)
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"

# Reload shell
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```
